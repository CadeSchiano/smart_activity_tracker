# Smart Activity Tracker

## 📌 Overview
Smart Activity Tracker is a Python-based application that allows users to manage and display activities in a structured and readable format. Each activity includes details such as title, category, location, and time.

This project is designed with clean separation of concerns and scalability in mind, making it easy to expand with features like user input, data persistence, filtering, or a web/API interface in the future.
